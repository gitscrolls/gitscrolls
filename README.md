## __🎯 What Are The GitScrolls?__

The __GitScrolls__ are ten sacred teachings that trace the archetypal journey every developer takes—from innocent beginner who commits "fix stuff" to wise mentor who helps others navigate the beautiful complexity of software development.

Born from the recognition that __software development is fundamentally about humans helping humans through code__, the GitScrolls wrap genuine technical wisdom in mythology that makes profound truths accessible, memorable, and kind.

> _"In the beginning was the commit, and the commit was with Tux, and the commit was good."_

### __🎭 The Aspects of Tux__
