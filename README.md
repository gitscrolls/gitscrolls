# 🐧 GitScrolls: The Odyssey of the Dev

> *“Scripture for the command line soul.”*

**GitScrolls** is a myth-tech codex — part narrative saga, part developer meditation.

It imagines a world where Linus Torvalds, Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, and Marcus Aurelius are trapped in a code review flame war…
…and *Tuxicles* is the poor junior dev just trying to merge to main.

Told across 16 sacred scrolls, it follows his exile, fall, and return — a branching path every developer knows:

- The first `git init`
- The fragile power of `merge`
- The silent shame of a failed deploy
- The wisdom earned from debugging your own sins
