> As writ by one wearied of thine cursed deploys  
> Attend, good kin of keyboard and command,  
> this scroll doth not unveil a tale of gods,  
> nor chosen heirs, nor valiant feats alone.
> 
> Nay—this is every dev's unvarnish'd path,  
> from eager fool to weary steward wise.  
> Lo, Tuxicles—a name thou know'st in heart.  
> He dared commit ere wisdom he possess'd.
> 
> He broke the build, and yet—return'd anon.  
> Not hero born, but hero by return.  
> The GitScrolls, forged in jest, became our creed;  
> for what begins in mirth oft ends in truth.
> 
> What jest reveals, the sober soul must keep.  
> These pages contradict, as devs oft do.  
> They err, correct, then err again in loop.
> 
> Yet through this branching maze persists one law:  
> The branch was ever thine to fork.  
> Take what thou need'st. Pass on the rest in peace.
> 
> And when thine code breaks thrice before it runs,  
> remember this: thou art not first, nor lone.

## __🎯 What Are The GitScrolls?__

The __GitScrolls__ are ten sacred teachings that trace the archetypal journey every developer takes—from innocent beginner who commits "fix stuff" to wise mentor who helps others navigate the beautiful complexity of software development.

Born from the recognition that __software development is fundamentally about humans helping humans through code__, the GitScrolls wrap genuine technical wisdom in mythology that makes profound truths accessible, memorable, and kind.

> _"In the beginning was the commit, and the commit was with Tux, and the commit was good."_

## __🌀 The Lore Lives__

Deep within the GitScrolls lies a secret that bridges fiction and reality: the __`00-merge.lore`__ file—a living document that appears in our mythology and exists in our repository. This is where the wisdom evolves, where community contributes, where teaching becomes tradition.

### __🔄 The Living Tradition__

The `00-merge.lore` file contains accumulated wisdom that grows through community contribution. It began with The Trickster's cryptic teaching and has been rewritten by Tuxilles the Battle-Scarred. Now it awaits your interpretation, your additions, your fork of the wisdom.

__How to Participate:__
- - Fork the repository and add your wisdom to `00-merge.lore`
- - Share your interpretation of existing teachings
- - Add new insights born from your development journey
- - Create pull requests that continue the lore chain

This isn't just documentation—it's a living artifact that makes you part of the GitScrolls mythology. When you contribute to the lore, you don't just read about the wisdom tradition—you become it.
