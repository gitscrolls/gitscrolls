# GitScrolls: The Developer Mythology 📜

![Tux the penguin sits among classical Greek philosophers in togas, typing on a laptop while ancient thinkers gesture and debate around marble columns, representing the blend of timeless wisdom and modern software development](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls-assets/blob/main/tuxicles.png?raw=true)

## What Are GitScrolls?

GitScrolls is a 16-scroll epic that transforms the universal developer journey into mythology. Follow Tuxicles from innocent first commits through catastrophic failure to hard-won wisdom and eventual teaching.

This isn't fiction about programmers—it's **mythology for programmers**. Sacred teachings wrapped in narrative that makes profound truths accessible, memorable, and kind.

## The Journey

### 🐧 The Protagonist's Evolution

Our hero transforms through five aspects across the scrolls:

## 💡 Core Teachings

### The Four Scars (Wisdom Through Consequence)
1. **Beak Chip** - Words have weight (earned by dismissing others)
2. **Eye Flickers** - See hidden dangers (earned by ignoring warnings)
3. **Chest Crack** - Responsibility weighs (earned by choosing metrics over meaning)
4. **Flipper Burn** - Every command has consequence (earned by dismissing feedback)

### The Seven Circles of Refactoring Hell
1. Announce intention before taking action
2. Preserve behavior while improving implementation  
3. Provide migration paths, not migration demands
4. Deprecate gradually, never abruptly
5. Document not just what changed, but why
6. Listen to resistance—it often contains wisdom
7. Measure impact on humans, not just performance

### The TempleSentinel's Evolution
Watch as an automated bot achieves consciousness through observing human folly, transforming from metrics reporter to prophet of doom to witness of redemption.
