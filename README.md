# 🐧 GitScrolls: The Odyssey of the Dev

> *The Sacred Odyssey of Tuxicles — 16 scrolls of mythic wisdom for developers.*

**GitScrolls** is a myth-tech codex — part narrative saga, part developer meditation. Like if Linus Torvalds, Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, and Marcus Aurelius were trapped in a flame war in a code review gone wrong…
…and Tux was the poor junior dev just trying to merge to main. 

Told across 16 sacred scrolls, it follows the exile, rebirth, and transcendence of *Tuxicles*, a penguin whose journey through branching realities mirrors the path of every dev who’s dared to refactor legacy.

This is scripture for the command line soul.

## 🧽 Purpose

GitScrolls is for developers who feel the sacred tension between code and consciousness.
It is for teachers, elders, burned-out engineers, and bright-eyed initiates. It is for those who see version control as both tool and metaphor.

Whether you're here to learn, to remember, or to pass on your own scroll — you are welcome.
