# 📜 LICENSE USAGE

*Hark!* — *these scrolls are shared freely, but not without covenant.* 

The wisdom within *The GitScrolls: The Chronicles of Tuxicles* is gifted to the world,  
yet bound by sacred terms, that it may guide, not be sold.

---

## ✅ Valiant Deeds _(Free Use)_

All are welcome — _encouraged_, even — to:

- Quote the scrolls in talks, blog posts, and sacred documentation (with attribution)
- Teach from them in bootcamps, workshops, guilds, and universities
- Translate them into the languages of your people
- Craft study guides, reflections, or teaching aids
- Share individual scrolls across the networked realms
- Create “inspired by” works — new paths forged by familiar stars
- Meme them, illustrate them, etch them into digital stone (the internet's highest honor)

So long as your intent is noble and your coin-purse closed,  
you are free to carry these teachings to those in need.

## ❌ Forbidden Arts _(Requires Permission)_

These acts walk the line of profit — and thus require a rite of passage:

- Selling books, lectures, or training built upon the scrolls
- Embedding scrolls in commercial software or product materials
- Using the scrolls in consulting without offering tribute
- Creating paid derivatives, adaptations, or translations for sale
- Locking the scrolls behind subscriptions, tokens, paywalls, or other gated systems

If coin shall flow, the covenant must be renewed.  
Speak with the steward.

## 🤔 Paths Between _(Ask First)_

Some uses dwell in ambiguity — not forbidden, but not yet blessed:

- Speaking at commercial conferences with scroll-derived content
- Internal training in corporate halls
- Sponsored content bearing the mark of the scrolls
- Podcasts discussing The GitScrolls, quoting, or teaching from its content
- Blog posts for brands that quote generously

In such cases, seek guidance.  
If the usage serves learning over profit, the way will likely be opened.
