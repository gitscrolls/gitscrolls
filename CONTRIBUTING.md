# CONTRIBUTING TO GITSCROLLS

_Last updated: 2025-06-09_

## 📜 The Nature of the Scrolls

GitScrolls is a narrative-philosophical text. It is not a wiki, and it is not open documentation.

It is a book — a living one — written and curated by its original author, *the Scrollkeeper*, J. Kirby Ross. Yet all sacred texts evolve through dialogue, not decree.

## ✨ Ways You *Can* Contribute

- **Start a Discussion**: Share reflections, propose additions, or ask questions via GitHub Discussions.
- **Open an Issue**: Found a typo, a contradiction, or a broken metaphor? Log it with care.
- **Fork the Scrolls**: Remix the teachings in your own voice — the Git way is the way of forking.
- **Submit a Pull Request**: If your contribution aligns with the existing mythos, feel free to open a PR. Submissions are reviewed through the lens of narrative cohesion, tone, and intent.

## 🔮 What We're *Not* Looking For

- Alternate character interpretations  
- Entirely different teaching styles  
- Rewrites of existing scrolls  
- Additions that disrupt narrative continuity  

These belong in your own fork — and we *bless* such offshoots. Share them proudly.

## 🧭 Canon vs Forks

GitScrolls is licensed for freedom — but curated with care.

All are free to fork, remix, and transform this work under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. That is the sacred right of all developers. But this repository — the canonical scrolls maintained by The Scrollkeeper — serves as the definitive narrative thread. As such:

| Action Type | Canonical Repo (this one) | Your Fork |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Fixing typos or bugs | ✅ Welcomed | ✅ Welcomed |
| Proposing clarifying language | 🔶 Considered | ✅ Encouraged |
| Rewriting scrolls or tone | ❌ Not accepted | ✅ Fully allowed |
| Creating new characters/arcs | ❌ Outside canon scope | ✅ Make it yours |
| Commercial use | ❌ Requires permission | 🔶 Contact us |

> *"Every commit is sacred — but not every branch merges upstream."*

If your contribution breaks tone, expands the universe in new ways, or radically reframes a scroll — that's not a rejection. That's an invitation to fork.

**We honor thoughtful forks. We bless divergent paths.**  
Make something powerful. Let us know when it's ready.

### Want Your Fork Featured?

If your forked project resonates with the GitScrolls spirit, we may showcase it in **FORKS.md** — a gallery of blessed deviations.

Send a message to scrollkeeper@gitscrolls.org with your project and a short note about how you built upon the scrolls.

*Canonical stewardship does not limit your freedom — it ensures the original thread remains legible.*  
*And your fork ensures the story never ends.*

## 🧙 Final Word

GitScrolls welcomes **insight, not overwrite**.

The Scrolls may change — but never casually, never by committee. If you believe something truly belongs in this canon, make your case. All sincere offerings will be received in the spirit of the sacred commit.
