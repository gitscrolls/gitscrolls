# CONTRIBUTING TO GITSCROLLS

_Last updated: 2025-06-09_

## ðŸ“œ The Nature of the Scrolls

GitScrolls is a narrative-philosophical text. It is not a wiki, and it is not open documentation.

It is a book â€” a living one â€” written and curated by its original author, *the Scrollkeeper*, J. Kirby Ross. Yet all sacred texts evolve through dialogue, not decree.

## âœ¨ Ways You *Can* Contribute

- **Start a Discussion**: Share reflections, propose additions, or ask questions via GitHub Discussions.
- **Open an Issue**: Found a typo, a contradiction, or a broken metaphor? Log it with care.
- **Fork the Scrolls**: Remix the teachings in your own voice â€” the Git way is the way of forking.
- **Submit a Pull Request**: If your contribution aligns with the existing mythos, feel free to open a PR. Submissions are reviewed through the lens of narrative cohesion, tone, and intent.

## ðŸ”® What We're *Not* Looking For

- Alternate character interpretations  
- Entirely different teaching styles  
- Rewrites of existing scrolls  
- Additions that disrupt narrative continuity  

These belong in your own fork â€” and we *bless* such offshoots. Share them proudly.

## ðŸ§™ Final Word

GitScrolls welcomes **insight, not overwrite**.

The Scrolls may change â€” but never casually, never by committee. If you believe something truly belongs in this canon, make your case. All sincere offerings will be received in the spirit of the sacred commit.

â€” With reverence and root access,  
**The Scrollkeeper**
