# CONTRIBUTING TO GITSCROLLS

_Last updated: 2025-06-12_

## The Nature of the Scrolls

GitScrolls is a narrative-philosophical text. It is not a wiki. It is not open documentation.  
It is a book — a living one — written and curated by its original author, _the Scrollkeeper_, J. Kirby Ross.

But even sacred texts evolve — not by decree, and never by committee, but through dialogue.  
All sincere insight is welcome. Not every branch will merge, but every thoughtful commit will be read.

## Ways You _Can_ Contribute

GitScrolls accepts contributions that preserve the tone, structure, and instructional intent of the manuscript.

### Preferred Contribution Methods

- **Open a GitHub Issue**  
  Found a typo, a contradiction, or a broken metaphor?  
  Submit an issue with:
    - The scroll and scene reference (e.g., “Scroll IV, Scene II”)
    - The original passage
    - A clear description of the issue
    - An optional suggested fix that aligns with the tone

- **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
  Minor corrections only:
    - Typos and grammar
    - Formatting and markdown cleanup
    - Consistent terminology or code snippets
    - Clarity improvements that do _not_ alter narrative voice or structure

  All PRs are reviewed through the lens of **narrative cohesion**, **voice**, and **canonical continuity**.

- **Start a Discussion**  
  Reflections, scroll interpretations, potential improvements — open a GitHub Discussion to share your insights.

- **Fork the Scrolls**  
  If your vision diverges in tone, theme, or structure, **fork freely**.  
  The Git way is the way of forking — and we bless such offshoots.

## What We're _Not_ Looking For

The following contributions are **outside scope for the canonical scrolls**:

- Alternate character interpretations  
- Major stylistic rewrites  
- New characters, arcs, or mythologies  
- Reframing the teaching philosophy  
- Replacing humor, metaphor, or didactic structure with incompatible approaches

These aren’t rejections — they’re signs your idea deserves its own scroll.  
**We honor forks. We do not absorb them.**

## Canon vs Forks

GitScrolls is licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.  
You may share, remix, adapt, and fork for non-commercial use, with attribution.  
But this repository represents the canonical, author-curated edition.

| Contribution Type              | Canonical Repo | Your Fork         |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Fixing typos or formatting    | Accepted       | Accepted          |
| Light line edits (clarity)    | Considered     | Encouraged        |
| Rewriting scrolls or tone     | Not accepted   | Fully encouraged  |
| New characters or expansions  | Not accepted   | Make it yours     |
| Commercial use                | Requires permission | Contact us     |

> "Every commit is sacred — but not every branch merges upstream."

If your vision challenges or expands the myth, we encourage you to fork the project and make something new.  
Let us know — we may include it in **FORKS.md**, our gallery of blessed deviations.

## Example Fork Scenarios

- A surrealist retelling of Scroll V featuring your own dev team as characters  
- A visual zine remix of GitScrolls for bootcamp students  
- A translated edition annotated with regional tech lore

## Editorial Status

The scrolls are complete as of [`v0.9.0-beta`](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta).  
We are currently in the **Developmental Editing** phase.  
For full details, see [`editorial/EDITORIAL_PLAN.md`](./editorial/EDITORIAL_PLAN.md)

Contributions during this time are most helpful in the form of:

- Typos and grammar corrections  
- Voice/clarity consistency suggestions  
- Identifying scrolls or scenes in need of better pacing or structure  
- Bug reports for broken links or markdown issues

## Want Your Fork Featured?

If your forked project resonates with the GitScrolls spirit, email **<scrollkeeper@gitscrolls.org>**  
Include a link, a short description, and how your work builds upon the Scrolls.  
We may feature it in `FORKS.md`.

## Final Word

> *“Insight, not overwrite. Commentary, not control.”*

GitScrolls welcomes dialogue, reverence, and precise technical mischief.  
The Scrolls may change — but never casually. Never without purpose.

All sincere offerings will be received in the spirit of the sacred commit.

With reverence and root access,  
**The Scrollkeeper**  
J. Kirby Ross
