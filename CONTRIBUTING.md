The future: [What this enables]

Refs: #issue-number
```

Example:
```
feat: Add team retrospective guide - Enable structured scroll discussions

The story: Teams needed a framework for incorporating GitScrolls into their
retrospectives. This guide provides structured formats and discussion prompts.

The journey: Researched existing retro formats and adapted them to incorporate
scroll wisdom. Tested with three teams for feedback.

The future: Teams can now easily integrate GitScrolls principles into their
regular practice, improving both code and culture.
