## 🌟 Fork Philosophy

> *"A fork is not a fracture—it's a new growth on the tree of knowledge."*

Every fork represents:
- A new perspective on eternal truths
- A bridge to communities we couldn't reach alone
- A testament to the story's resilience
- Proof that wisdom multiplies when shared

We don't just permit forks—we celebrate them. Each divergence strengthens the whole.
