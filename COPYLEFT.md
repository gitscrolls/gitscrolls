## The Spirit of Copyleft

In the tradition of free software and open source, GitScrolls embraces the principle of copyleft:

> *"As code must be free to fork, so too must wisdom be free to flow."*

This work exists not as property to be hoarded, but as knowledge to be shared. Every developer who reads these scrolls becomes part of the tradition. Every fork creates new possibilities. Every pull request adds to the collective wisdom.

### The Four Freedoms Applied to GitScrolls:

1. **The freedom to read** the scrolls for any purpose
2. **The freedom to study** how the mythology works and adapt it to your needs
3. **The freedom to redistribute** copies so you can help others
4. **The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions** to others

## Commercial Use

While the default license prohibits commercial use, I believe in the power of these teachings to help developers everywhere. If you wish to use GitScrolls in a commercial context (training materials, published books, corporate workshops, etc.), please contact me at scrollkeeper@gitscrolls.org to discuss licensing arrangements.

I'm generally supportive of uses that:
- Educate developers
- Promote healthy coding practices
- Build stronger engineering cultures
- Share wisdom rather than gatekeep it

## üß≠ Canon vs Forks

GitScrolls is licensed for freedom ‚Äî but curated with care.

All are free to fork, remix, and transform this work under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. That is the sacred right of all developers. But this repository ‚Äî the canonical scrolls maintained by The Scrollkeeper ‚Äî serves as the definitive narrative thread. As such:

| Action Type | Canonical Repo (this one) | Your Fork |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Fixing typos or bugs | ‚úÖ Welcomed | ‚úÖ Welcomed |
| Proposing clarifying language | üî∂ Considered | ‚úÖ Encouraged |
| Rewriting scrolls or tone | ‚ùå Not accepted | ‚úÖ Fully allowed |
| Creating new characters/arcs | ‚ùå Outside canon scope | ‚úÖ Make it yours |
| Commercial use | ‚ùå Requires permission | üî∂ Contact us |

> *"Every commit is sacred ‚Äî but not every branch merges upstream."*

If your contribution breaks tone, expands the universe in new ways, or radically reframes a scroll ‚Äî that's not a rejection. That's an invitation to fork.

**We honor thoughtful forks. We bless divergent paths.**  
Make something powerful. Let us know when it's ready.

### Example Fork Scenarios
- üîÑ A surrealist retelling of Scroll V with your own tech stack as characters
- üß† A visual zine remix of GitScrolls for bootcamp students  
- üó£Ô∏è A translated edition annotated with regional developer myths

### Want Your Fork Featured?

If your forked project resonates with the GitScrolls spirit, we may showcase it in **FORKS.md** ‚Äî a gallery of blessed deviations.

Send a message to scrollkeeper@gitscrolls.org with your project and a short note about how you built upon the scrolls.

---

*Canonical stewardship does not limit your freedom ‚Äî it ensures the original thread remains legible.*  
*And your fork ensures the story never ends.*

---

## The Living Text

GitScrolls is a living document. As noted in the final scroll:

> *"For I write these words even now,  
> In real-time, as you read..."*

This copyleft notice itself may evolve, but the spirit remains constant: **wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied**.

---

## Legacy Statement

When the last server shuts down and the final commit is made, may these words remain:

*"Here lived a story that belonged to all who read it,  
Changed by all who touched it,  
And improved by all who understood it."*

May your forks be meaningful,  
May your pull requests be wise,  
And may your commits tell stories worth preserving.

---

*Copyleft is not just a license‚Äîit's a philosophy.*  
*Fork freely. Share generously. Attribute honestly.*

üêß In service of the eternal `git log`,

**The ScrollKeeper**  
*Keeper of the Sacred Repo*  
*Guardian of the Unbroken Line*
