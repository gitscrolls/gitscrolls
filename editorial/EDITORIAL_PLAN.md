# EDITORIAL PLAN for GitScrolls: The Epic of Tuxicles

> "The scrolls are written, but not yet canonized.  
> Each edit is a chisel strike upon mythic stone."  
> â€” The Chronicler

## Repository

<https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls>

## Current Version

**Tag**: [v0.9.0-beta](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta)  
**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Status**: Full manuscript complete; editorial phase initiated  
**Total Scrolls**: 16

## Editorial Vision

*GitScrolls: The Epic of Tuxicles* is a hybrid manuscript that blends narrative fiction with technical instruction.  

It is designed to function simultaneously as:

- A mythic journey through software development (following Tuxicles)  
- An educational resource on version control, team workflows, and architectural principles  
- A literary satire and cultural artifact for developers

This editorial plan outlines the structured workflow that will refine the manuscript to publication-grade quality while preserving its tone, structure, and intent.  
The purpose is not to sanitize or standardize â€” but to clarify, amplify, and canonize.

The process will not merely polish prose.  
**It will consecrate a teaching relic.**

## Phased Editorial Workflow

Each phase may be tracked in a dedicated Git branch (e.g., `edit/dev`, `edit/line`).

### Editorial Task Tracking  

All editorial work is tracked via GitHub Projects, organized by phase and scroll. Â 

Each proposed edit, note, or refinement is submitted as an Issue and assigned a label based on scroll, phase, and type. These issues are surfaced in the editorial project board, which is updated continuously.  

Tasks are grouped into:

- [ ] ðŸ”œ Developmental Edit *(`v0.9.1`â€”July 1st, 2025)* ðŸ”„
- [ ] Line Edit *(`v0.9.2`â€”August 1st, 2025)*
- [ ] Copyedit *(`v0.9.3`â€”September 1st, 2025)*
- [ ] Proofread *(`v0.9.4`â€”October 1st, 2025)*
- [ ] Official Release *(`v1.0.0`â€”October 14th, 2025)*

### Phase 1: Developmental Edit  

*"Here the scaffold is tested. The arc is clarified. The excess burned away."*

Focus:

- Scroll structure and sequence  
- Thematic flow and pedagogical clarity  
- Tuxiclesâ€™ arc and narrative pacing  
- Integration of narrative and instructional elements  
- Elimination of redundancy and smoothing of scroll-to-scroll transitions

Deliverables:

- Revised versions of key scrolls with restructured sections as needed  
- Editorial report outlining major changes  
- Internal tag or branch for post-dev-edit state (e.g., `v0.9.1-dev`)

---

### Phase 2: Line Edit  

*"The scroll is intact â€” now we polish the glyphs. Let every sentence shine with purpose."*

Focus:

- Sentence-level clarity and rhythm  
- Tone consistency (narrative voice, Chronicler voice, character dialogue)  
- Readability of both literary and technical content  
- Identification of awkward phrasing, ambiguous passages, or flat exposition

Deliverables:

- On-scroll markup or tracked changes in markdown files  
- Line-level revision suggestions submitted as GitHub Issues or PRs

---

### Phase 3: Copyedit  

*"Syntax is sanctity. The margin matters. The comma must not wander."*

Focus:

- Grammar, spelling, punctuation  
- Markdown formatting and semantic consistency  
- Terminology and code example consistency  
- Internal reference alignment (e.g., scroll titles, footnotes)

Deliverables:

- Cleaned manuscript files in-place  
- Reviewed and corrected markdown using a consistent style guide

---

### Phase 4: Proofread  

*"The final incantation before the scrolls are sealed and shared with the world."*

Focus:

- Final pass before public release  
- Verification of rendering on GitHub  
- Link integrity and navigation  
- Typesetting considerations for PDF/ePub/print

Deliverables:

- Tagged release candidate for version 1.0.0  
- Canonized version of the GitScrolls

## Contribution Guidance

GitScrolls is a curated literary work, not a public wiki or open documentation project.  
However, thoughtful contributions are welcomed through the proper channels.

### How to Contribute

- **GitHub Issues** may be used to report:
    - Typos, grammar issues, and formatting inconsistencies  
    - Clarity problems or confusing phrasing (suggested line edits)  
    - Broken links or rendering issues  
    - Deviations in voice, tone, or style between scrolls

- **Pull Requests** may be submitted for:
    - Minor corrections with clear justification  
    - Fixes that adhere to the existing voice and tone  
    - Markdown and semantic formatting cleanup

If you're unsure whether a suggestion aligns with canon, open an Issue instead of a PR.  
Every sincere insight will be received with care â€” not all will be merged.
