# Narrative Testing Framework

## Overview

This document describes a testing framework designed specifically for narrative-driven documentation and storytelling projects. While traditional software testing ensures code correctness, narrative testing validates the consistency, coherence, and structural integrity of interconnected text documents.

## Why Test Stories?

Complex narrative projects face unique challenges:

1. **Consistency Drift**: As stories evolve, character names, timelines, and world-building elements can become inconsistent
2. **Link Rot**: References between documents may break as files are renamed or reorganized
3. **Timeline Paradoxes**: Events may be referenced out of sequence or with conflicting dates
4. **Character Evolution**: Characters that transform throughout a narrative must maintain logical progression
5. **Technical Accuracy**: Technical examples embedded in narrative must remain valid

## Core Principles

### 1. Automated Validation
Just as continuous integration catches code regressions, narrative testing catches story inconsistencies automatically.

### 2. Graph-Based Analysis
Stories are networks of interconnected elements. Testing frameworks should model these relationships as graphs to detect structural issues.

### 3. Semantic Understanding
Unlike code testing which focuses on syntax, narrative testing must understand semantic relationships between text elements.

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
Start with simple structural tests (broken links) and progressively add semantic tests (character consistency).

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: For parsing and analysis logic
- **Jest**: Test runner with good reporting capabilities
- **Docker**: Containerized environment for consistent testing
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on pull requests

### Test Categories

1. **Structural Tests**: Link validation, file existence, metadata consistency
2. **Semantic Tests**: Character tracking, timeline validation, terminology consistency
3. **Style Tests**: Formatting consistency, quote attribution, markdown linting
4. **Domain Tests**: Technical accuracy, command validation, code example testing

## Benefits

1. **Confidence in Changes**: Authors can refactor narratives knowing tests will catch inconsistencies
2. **Collaborative Safety**: Multiple contributors can work without fear of breaking continuity
3. **Documentation as Code**: Apply software engineering best practices to documentation
4. **Reader Trust**: Validated narratives provide better reader experience

## Getting Started

See the [test documentation](./tests/) for specific test suite implementations and the [development guide](./tests/development.md) for contributing new test cases.

## Future Directions

- **AI-Assisted Validation**: Use language models to detect subtle semantic inconsistencies
- **Visual Timeline Generation**: Automatically generate timeline visualizations from parsed events
- **Character Relationship Graphs**: Visualize character interactions and evolution
- **Cross-Language Support**: Extend framework to support narratives in multiple languages
