# Mentoring Guide

A framework for using GitScrolls principles to mentor developers at all levels.

## Introduction

Mentoring through GitScrolls combines technical guidance with wisdom practices, creating a holistic approach to developer growth. This guide helps mentors use the scrolls to address not just coding skills, but the human aspects of software development.

## The GitScrolls Mentoring Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Technical skill and wisdom grow together**
2. **Every developer has something to teach**
3. **Mistakes are teachers, not failures**

## Remember

Mentoring through GitScrolls is not about having all the answersâ€”it's about asking better questions. Your role is to create space for discovery, provide support through challenges, and celebrate growth along the way.

The best mentors learn as much as they teach, grow as much as they guide, and discover that in lifting others, they too rise.

May your mentoring relationships flourish with wisdom and compassion! ðŸŒŸ
