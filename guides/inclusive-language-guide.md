# Inclusive Language Guide

Community standards for compassionate and inclusive communication in GitScrolls contributions.

## Introduction

Language shapes culture. In the GitScrolls community, we choose words that welcome, include, and honor all developers regardless of background, experience level, identity, or perspective. This guide helps contributors communicate in ways that build bridges rather than barriers.

## Core Principles

### 1. Assume Good Intentions
- People are doing their best with what they know
- Mistakes are opportunities for gentle learning
- Focus on impact, not intent, when addressing issues

### 2. Welcome All Journeys
- Every developer's path is valid
- Experience comes in many forms
- Wisdom doesn't require seniority

### 3. Honor Diversity
- Technical excellence has many expressions
- Different perspectives strengthen solutions
- Cultural contexts enrich understanding

## Language Guidelines

### General Communication

**Use**
- "When we write code..." (inclusive)
- "Developers might consider..." (open-ended)
- "One approach is..." (non-prescriptive)
- "In my experience..." (personal, not universal)

**Avoid**
- "Good developers always..." (gatekeeping)
- "Obviously..." (assumptions)
- "Just..." (minimizing complexity)
- "Real programmers..." (exclusionary)

### Technical Discussions

**Use**
- "This could be more efficient"
- "Alternative approach"
- "Room for improvement"
- "Learning opportunity"

**Avoid**
- "This is wrong"
- "Bad code"
- "Stupid mistake"
- "Anyone can see"

### Experience Levels

**Use**
- "Developers new to [specific technology]"
- "Those exploring [concept]"
- "Someone learning [skill]"
- "Engineers at all levels"

**Avoid**
- "Junior/Senior" (when not necessary)
- "Newbie/Noob"
- "Rock star/Ninja/Guru"
- "Non-technical"

## Inclusive Patterns

### Gender-Inclusive Language

**Examples:**
- They/them as singular pronouns
- "Engineers" not "guys"
- "Workforce" not "manpower"
- "Crafted" not "manned"

**In Documentation:**
```
"When a developer commits their code..."
"The engineer should test their changes..."
"Each contributor brings their perspective..."
```

### Ability-Inclusive Language

**Use**
- "Navigate to the file"
- "Review the code"
- "Locate the bug"
- "Process the data"

**Avoid**
- "See the error" (assumes sight)
- "Hear me out" (assumes hearing)
- "Walk through" (assumes mobility)
- "Crippling bug" (ableist metaphor)

### Culture-Inclusive Language

**Consider:**
- Not everyone shares cultural references
- Idioms may not translate
- Time zones vary globally
- Work schedules differ

**Examples:**
```
Instead of: "Let's sync after the holiday"
Use: "Let's sync next week (accounting for holidays)"

Instead of: "Common sense solution"
Use: "Straightforward solution"
```

## Code Comments & Documentation

### Welcoming Comments

```javascript
// This function handles user authentication
// For questions, see our auth guide or ask in #help
function authenticate(user) {
  // Validate credentials (see security policy)
  // Return token if valid, error details if not
}
```

### Educational Error Messages

```javascript
// Instead of: "Invalid input"
throw new Error(
  "The date format should be YYYY-MM-DD. " +
  "Example: 2024-03-15. See docs/date-handling.md for more info."
);
```

### Inclusive Examples

```javascript
// Use diverse names in examples
const users = [
  { name: "Amara", role: "developer" },
  { name: "Chen", role: "designer" },
  { name: "Priya", role: "manager" },
  { name: "JoÃ£o", role: "analyst" }
];

// Avoid stereotypes in scenarios
// Good: "An engineer reviewing code..."
// Avoid: "Bob the builder..." or assumed gender roles
```

## Community Interactions

### Pull Request Language

**Opening a PR:**
```
"I've attempted to address issue #123. This approach [explanation].
I'm open to feedback and alternative suggestions.
Thanks for reviewing!"
```

**Requesting Changes:**
```
"Thanks for this contribution! I have a suggestion that might
improve [specific aspect]. What do you think about [alternative]?
Happy to discuss further!"
```

### Issue Discussions

**Reporting Issues:**
```
"I encountered unexpected behavior when [specific action].
Environment: [details]
Expected: [what you expected]
Actual: [what happened]
I'm happy to provide more details or test fixes!"
```

**Responding to Issues:**
```
"Thanks for reporting this! I can see how that would be frustrating.
Let me investigate and get back to you. In the meantime,
a workaround might be [suggestion]."
```

### Code Review Language

See the [Review Guide](code-review-guide.md) for detailed examples, but remember:
- Critique code, not coders
- Suggest, don't demand
- Explain the why
- Appreciate the effort

## Handling Mistakes

### When You Make a Mistake

```
"I apologize for my language choice. Thank you for pointing that out.
I'll be more mindful going forward."
```

### When Others Make Mistakes

```
"Hey, just a gentle note - the term [term] can be exclusionary.
Maybe we could use [alternative] instead? Thanks for considering!"
```

### Creating Safe Spaces

- Address issues privately when possible
- Focus on education, not shame
- Model inclusive language
- Appreciate corrections gracefully

### Technical Jargon

- Define terms on first use
- Link to glossaries
- Provide context
- Remember not everyone shares your background

### Humor and Personality

- Humor can build community
- Ensure jokes don't exclude
- Avoid sarcasm in text
- When in doubt, be kind

## Remember

Inclusive language is not about perfectionâ€”it's about intention, attention, and continuous improvement. We all make mistakes. What matters is our willingness to learn, adjust, and create spaces where everyone can contribute their best work.

The goal is not to police language but to build a community where everyone feels welcomed, valued, and empowered to grow.

May your words build bridges to wisdom! ðŸŒ‰
