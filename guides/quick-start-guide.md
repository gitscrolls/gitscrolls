# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to GitScrolls - A 5-minute orientation to sacred development practices.

## What Are GitScrolls?

GitScrolls are nine archetypal patterns that transform how we approach software development by integrating timeless wisdom with modern coding practices. They help teams build more compassionate, sustainable, and meaningful software.

## The Core Philosophy

At its heart, GitScrolls teaches that:
- **Code is a living document** of our intentions and values
- **Development is a human activity** that benefits from wisdom traditions
- **Technical excellence and compassion** are not opposing forces
- **Every commit** is an opportunity for mindful practice

## The Nine Scrolls at a Glance

1. **Sacred Timeline** - Honor the past, embrace the present, build for the future
2. **Meaningful Messages** - Craft commit messages that tell the story of your code's evolution
3. **Oracle of Love** - Build trust through transparent, empathetic code reviews
4. **Sacred Freedom** - Release with intention and celebrate shared achievements
5. **Compassionate Change** - Refactor with care for both code and colleagues
6. **Creative Chaos** - Transform bugs into opportunities for growth
7. **Sacred Timing** - Balance urgency with sustainability
8. **Eternal Legacy** - Write code that serves future generations
9. **Sacred Teaching** - Share knowledge generously and learn continuously

## Your First Steps

### 1. Choose Your Path
- **Individual Developer**: Start with Scroll II (Meaningful Messages) to transform your daily commits
- **Team Lead**: Begin with Scroll III (Oracle of Love) to enhance code reviews
- **Project Manager**: Explore Scroll VII (Sacred Timing) for sustainable pacing

### 2. Practice One Principle
Pick one principle from your chosen scroll and apply it this week:
- Write one commit message that tells a story
- Leave one code review comment that builds up a colleague
- Take one moment to appreciate legacy code before refactoring

### 3. Reflect and Share
At week's end, reflect on how the practice affected your work:
- Did it change how you approached problems?
- What felt different about your interactions?
- What would you like to explore next?

## Quick Reference Card

```
When writing code, ask yourself:
â–¡ Am I building with compassion for future maintainers?
â–¡ Do my messages convey both what and why?
â–¡ Am I balancing speed with sustainability?
â–¡ How can I share what I'm learning?

When reviewing code, remember:
â–¡ Behind every PR is a human being
â–¡ Critique the code, support the coder
â–¡ Share knowledge, not just corrections
â–¡ Celebrate what works well

When facing challenges, consider:
â–¡ What is this bug teaching me?
â–¡ How can we grow from this mistake?
â–¡ What wisdom can guide us forward?
â–¡ Who else might benefit from this learning?
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore a Full Scroll**: Read one complete scroll in `/scrolls/`
2. **Join the Discussion**: Check [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls/discussions) for ongoing conversations
3. **Try a Pathway**: See `/guides/reading-pathways.md` for curated journeys
4. **Share Your Experience**: Contribute your insights to help others on their path

Remember: GitScrolls is not about perfection but about bringing more consciousness, compassion, and community to our craft. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.

May your code compile and your spirit soar! ðŸš€
