# Team Guide

How to use GitScrolls for team retrospectives, discussions, and culture building.

## Introduction

GitScrolls offers teams a unique framework for discussing not just what we build, but how and why we build it. This guide helps teams integrate GitScrolls principles into their regular practices, creating more mindful, compassionate, and effective development cultures.

## Getting Started with Your Team

### 1. Introduce the Concept
**In your next team meeting:**
- Share the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md)
- Read one scroll together (recommend starting with [Scroll III: Oracle of Love](../scrolls/03-Oracle-of-Love.md))
- Discuss: "What resonated with you? What felt challenging?"
- No pressure to adopt everythingâ€”start with curiosity

### 2. Choose Your First Experiment
**Pick one practice to try for two weeks:**
- Meaningful commit messages ([Scroll II](../scrolls/02-Meaningful-Messages.md))
- Compassionate code reviews ([Scroll III](../scrolls/03-Oracle-of-Love.md))
- Mindful refactoring ([Scroll V](../scrolls/05-Compassionate-Change.md))
- Celebrating releases ([Scroll IV](../scrolls/04-Sacred-Freedom.md))

### 3. Create Safe Space
- Acknowledge this is different from typical tech discussions
- Emphasize no one needs to be "spiritual" or "philosophical"
- Focus on practical improvements to team dynamics
- Respect diverse perspectives and comfort levels

## GitScrolls in Retrospectives

### The Scroll-Based Retro Format

**Opening (5 minutes)**
- Choose a scroll relevant to recent challenges
- Read the key principles aloud
- Set intention: "How might this wisdom help us?"

**Reflection (15 minutes)**
- What from this scroll describes our current state?
- Where are we already practicing these principles?
- What opportunities do we see for growth?

**Discussion (20 minutes)**
- Share specific examples from recent sprints
- Connect scroll principles to real situations
- Brainstorm practical applications

**Action Items (10 minutes)**
- Choose 1-2 specific practices to implement
- Assign champions (not enforcers) for each practice
- Set a check-in date to review progress

### Sample Retrospective Themes

**"Our commits are cryptic"**
- Use [Scroll II: Meaningful Messages](../scrolls/02-Meaningful-Messages.md)
- Practice: Commit message storytelling workshop
- Goal: Every commit tells a clear story this sprint

**"Code reviews feel harsh"**
- Use [Scroll III: Oracle of Love](../scrolls/03-Oracle-of-Love.md)
- Practice: "Compliment sandwich" reviews
- Goal: Balance critique with appreciation

**"We're burning out"**
- Use [Scroll VII: Sacred Timing](../scrolls/07-Sacred-Timing.md)
- Practice: Sustainable pacing check-ins
- Goal: Identify and address overcommitment

**"Too many bugs"**
- Use [Scroll VI: Creative Chaos](../scrolls/06-Creative-Chaos.md)
- Practice: Bug pattern analysis with compassion
- Goal: Learn from bugs without blame

## Team Discussions & Book Club

### GitScrolls Book Club Format

**Week 1-10: One Scroll Per Week**

**Before Meeting:**
- Everyone reads assigned scroll
- Note one insight and one question
- Try one practice from the scroll

**During Meeting (45 minutes):**
- Round 1 (15 min): Share insights
- Round 2 (15 min): Discuss questions
- Round 3 (15 min): Plan team experiments

**After Meeting:**
- Document insights in team wiki
- Share experiments in team chat
- Support each other's practice

### Discussion Prompts by Scroll

**Scroll I - Sacred Timeline**
- How do we honor our codebase's history?
- What legacy are we creating?
- How can we better document our journey?

**Scroll II - Meaningful Messages**
- What story do our commits tell?
- How can we make our intentions clearer?
- What would future devs want to know?

**Scroll III - Oracle of Love**
- How do our reviews affect team morale?
- Where can we add more encouragement?
- How do we handle disagreements?

**Scroll IV - Sacred Freedom**
- How do we celebrate achievements?
- What rituals mark our releases?
- How can we share credit better?

**Scroll V - Compassionate Change**
- How do we approach legacy code?
- When do we refactor with judgment?
- How can we honor past decisions?

**Scroll VI - Creative Chaos**
- How do we respond to failures?
- What can our bugs teach us?
- Where is chaos actually creative?

**Scroll VII - Sacred Timing**
- Are our deadlines sustainable?
- How do we handle urgency?
- Where can we build in rest?

**Scroll VIII - Eternal Legacy**
- What code will outlive us?
- How do we document for the future?
- What standards serve generations?

**Scroll IX - Sacred Teaching**
- How do we share knowledge?
- Who needs mentoring?
- What wisdom can we document?

**Scroll X - The Return Home**
- How do we complete learning cycles?
- What does mastery look like?
- How do we help others begin their journey?

## Building Team Culture

### Creating Team Rituals

**Daily Stand-up Enhancement**
- Start with a GitScrolls principle of the day
- Share how yesterday's principle influenced work
- Choose tomorrow's principle together

**Sprint Ceremonies**
- **Planning**: "What scroll guides this sprint?"
- **Review**: "How did we honor our chosen principles?"
- **Retro**: "What wisdom emerged from our work?"

**Code Review Rituals**
- Begin reviews with appreciation
- Ask "What can I learn here?"
- Close with encouragement

### Team Agreements Inspired by GitScrolls

**From Scroll II - Commit Message Template:**
```
[Type]: [What] - [Why]

The story: [What changed and why it matters]
The journey: [Challenges faced, decisions made]
The future: [What this enables]
```

**From Scroll III - Review Guidelines:**
1. Start with what works well
2. Frame critiques as questions
3. Offer alternatives, not just problems
4. End with encouragement
5. Remember the human behind the code

**From Scroll VII - Sustainable Pacing:**
- No deploys after 4 PM Fridays
- Rotation for on-call duties
- Mandatory breaks after major releases
- Celebrating both speed and rest

### Handling Resistance

**Common Concerns & Responses:**

**"This is too touchy-feely"**
- Focus on practical outcomes
- Use metrics: review turnaround, bug rates, team satisfaction
- Start with technical scrolls (II, V, VIII)

**"We don't have time"**
- Start with 5-minute practices
- Integrate into existing meetings
- Show efficiency gains from better communication

**"This isn't how we do things"**
- Frame as experiments, not changes
- Respect the current culture while exploring
- Let volunteers lead by example

## Remember

GitScrolls is not about imposing philosophy on engineeringâ€”it's about discovering the wisdom already present in our best practices and amplifying it. Every team's journey will be unique. Trust your team's wisdom, start small, and let the practices evolve organically.

The goal is not perfection but progress, not conformity but community, not rules but wisdom.

May your team's code and culture flourish together! ðŸŒ±
