# GitScrolls FAQ

Frequently asked questions about the Sacred Teachings and their practical application.

## General Questions

### What are the GitScrolls?
The GitScrolls are ten archetypal teachings that trace the journey every developer takes—from innocent beginner to wise mentor. They combine genuine technical wisdom with engaging mythology to make development principles accessible, memorable, and practical.

### Are the GitScrolls religious or spiritual?
No. While they use mythological language and archetypal storytelling, the GitScrolls are secular wisdom about software development. The "sacred" language is metaphorical—recognizing that good development practices deserve reverence and care. Developers of all backgrounds and beliefs can benefit from the teachings.

### Do I need to read all ten scrolls?
Not necessarily. Each scroll addresses different aspects of development. You can:
- Read individual scrolls based on current challenges
- Follow one of the [Reading Pathways](guides/reading-pathways.md) 
- Start with the [Quick Start Guide](guides/quick-start-guide.md)

### How long does it take to read the GitScrolls?
- Complete collection: 2-3 hours
- Individual scroll: 15-20 minutes
- Quick Start Guide: 5 minutes

### Are the GitScrolls suitable for beginners?
Absolutely! The progression from Tuxicles (the innocent) to Tux Transcendent (the teacher) mirrors the natural learning journey. Beginners will find practical guidance, while experienced developers will discover deeper wisdom about mentoring and legacy.

## Practical Application

### How do I use GitScrolls with my team?
See the [Team Guide](guides/team-guide.md) for specific approaches:
- Use scrolls as retrospective themes
- Integrate principles into code reviews
- Create scroll-based book clubs
- Apply teachings to daily standup discussions

### Can I use GitScrolls for teaching/training?
Yes! The [Mentoring Guide](guides/mentoring-guide.md) provides frameworks for:
- One-on-one mentoring using scroll principles
- Team workshops and discussions
- Bootcamp or university curricula integration

### Do the GitScrolls work for non-Git version control?
While the stories reference Git specifically, the underlying principles apply to all collaborative software development:
- Respecting shared history
- Clear communication in commits
- Thoughtful code reviews
- Sustainable development practices

### How do I convince my team to try GitScrolls?
Start small:
- Share one scroll that addresses a current team challenge
- Focus on practical outcomes rather than philosophy
- Use the [Crisis Intervention Path](guides/reading-pathways.md#the-problem-solvers-route) for specific issues
- Let improvements speak for themselves

## Content Questions

### Why is the writing style so elaborate?
The mythological style serves several purposes:
- Makes technical concepts more memorable
- Creates emotional connection to dry practices
- Provides shared vocabulary for teams
- Honors the craft of software development

### Are the technical recommendations sound?
Yes. While wrapped in story, the GitScrolls contain battle-tested wisdom:
- Version control best practices
- Code review techniques
- Testing philosophies
- Deployment strategies
- Legacy code maintenance

### What if I disagree with a scroll's teaching?
That's perfectly fine! The scrolls are invitations to think, not commandments to follow. Use what helps, adapt what partially fits, and ignore what doesn't serve your context.

### Why penguins?
Tux is the Linux mascot, connecting to the open source tradition. Penguins are also:
- Collaborative (they huddle for warmth)
- Resilient (they survive harsh conditions)
- Endearing (making difficult topics approachable)
- Archetypal (innocent yet capable of wisdom)

## Community Questions

### Can I contribute to the GitScrolls?
Yes! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. We welcome:
- Translations to other languages
- Real-world application examples
- Commentary and interpretations
- Improvements to documentation

### Can I use GitScrolls in my company/course/book?
Yes! The GitScrolls are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE) with the Sacred Commit Clause encouraging compassionate use. You can:
- Use freely in commercial settings
- Include in training materials
- Reference in presentations
- Build upon for your own content

### How do I cite the GitScrolls?
```
The GitScrolls: Sacred Wisdom for Software Development
https://github.com/gitscrolls/gitscrolls
Licensed under MIT with Sacred Commit Clause
```

### Are there plans for expansion?
The ten core scrolls are complete, but the tradition continues through:
- Community-contributed "Lost Scrolls"
- Translations and cultural adaptations
- Practical tools and integrations
- Educational materials and workshops

## Technical Questions

### Will there be a CLI tool?
We're exploring CLI tools, editor extensions, and git hooks that could share scroll wisdom at appropriate moments. Watch the repository for updates.

### Can I download the GitScrolls offline?
Yes! The entire repository can be cloned for offline reading. We may also create e-book formats in the future.

### How do I stay updated?
- Watch the GitHub repository for updates
- Check the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for new releases
- Join community discussions for the latest developments

## Philosophy Questions

### What makes GitScrolls different from other development advice?
Most technical advice focuses purely on mechanics. GitScrolls address the human aspects:
- Why practices matter, not just how to do them
- Emotional challenges of development work
- Community and relationship building
- Personal growth through technical practice

### Do the GitScrolls replace other development resources?
No! They complement existing resources by providing:
- Philosophical framework for understanding why practices matter
- Memorable stories that make principles stick
- Shared vocabulary for teams to discuss development culture
- Bridge between technical skills and human wisdom

### Why does this matter?
Software development is fundamentally about humans coordinating to solve problems through code. The GitScrolls help developers see their work as meaningful, connect with their colleagues more effectively, and build software that serves humanity with greater compassion and wisdom.
