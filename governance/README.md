# GitScrolls Governance

How decisions are made and the project evolves with wisdom and community.

## Governance Philosophy

GitScrolls governance embodies the principles it teaches:
- **The Unbroken Line**: Honor the past, act in the present, build for the future
- **The Chronicle of Forgotten Messages**: Communicate decisions clearly and transparently
- **The Oracle's Testament of Devotion**: Make decisions with compassion for all affected
- **The Schism Scrolls**: Empower contributors while maintaining coherence

## Decision-Making Structure

### The Council of Maintainers
Core maintainers who steward the project's vision and quality.

**Current Maintainers:**
- *Open positions - nominate yourself or others!*

**Responsibilities:**
- Guard the project's philosophical integrity
- Review and merge contributions
- Guide major decisions
- Support community growth
- Model GitScrolls principles

### The Community Voice
All contributors have a say in GitScrolls' evolution through:
- Issue discussions
- Pull request feedback
- Community proposals
- Scroll interpretations

### The Path of Consensus
Decisions follow this pattern:
1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes
2. **Discussion**: Community explores implications
3. **Refinement**: Proposals evolve with feedback
4. **Consensus**: Seek agreement, not just majority
5. **Implementation**: Changes made with care

## Types of Decisions

### ðŸŸ¢ Community Decisions (Anyone can approve)

**Process**: Single maintainer review + merge

### ðŸŸ¡ Significant Decisions (Maintainer consensus)

**Process**: 2+ maintainer approval + 1 week comment period

### ðŸ”´ Sacred Decisions (Full community involvement)

**Process**: RFC + 30-day discussion + maintainer consensus + community support

## The RFC Process

For significant changes, we use Request for Comments (RFC):

### RFC Template
```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

**Author**: @[handle]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [Draft/Discussion/Final/Implemented]

## Summary
[One paragraph explanation]

## Motivation
[Why is this needed?]

## Detailed Design
[The full proposal]

## Implications
[How this affects the project and community]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other approaches explored]

## Open Questions
[What needs community input?]
```

### RFC Stages
1. **Draft** (Day 1-7): Initial proposal and early feedback
2. **Discussion** (Day 8-30): Community input and refinement
3. **Final** (Day 31+): Proposal finalized for decision
4. **Implemented**: Change made and documented

## Becoming a Maintainer

### The Path
1. **Contribute Consistently**: Show dedication through quality contributions
2. **Embody Principles**: Demonstrate GitScrolls values in interactions
3. **Support Community**: Help others, review PRs, answer questions
4. **Show Wisdom**: Make thoughtful decisions and suggestions
5. **Accept Nomination**: Be nominated by existing maintainer or self-nominate

### Maintainer Expectations
- Dedicate ~2-5 hours per week
- Review PRs within 7 days
- Participate in major decisions
- Model inclusive behavior
- Support community growth

### Stepping Down
Maintainers can step down anytime with gratitude for their service. We honor all seasons of contribution.

## Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

### Level 1: Direct Discussion
- Assume good intentions
- Seek understanding
- Find common ground
- Focus on project benefit

### Level 2: Mediation
- Involve neutral maintainer
- Clarify positions
- Explore compromises
- Document resolution

### Level 3: Council Decision
- Present to all maintainers
- Allow all voices
- Seek wisdom over winning
- Accept group decision

## Code of Conduct

See our [Inclusive Language Guide](../guides/inclusive-language-guide.md) and remember:
- Treat all with respect
- Welcome diverse perspectives
- Focus on constructive dialogue
- Build community, not walls

## Evolution Process

GitScrolls governance itself can evolve:

1. **Observe**: Notice what works and what doesn't
2. **Propose**: Suggest improvements via RFC
3. **Discuss**: Explore implications thoroughly
4. **Implement**: Make changes gradually
5. **Reflect**: Assess impact and adjust

## Transparency Commitments

- All decisions documented publicly
- Discussion happens in open forums
- Reasoning explained clearly
- Dissent noted respectfully
- Process open to scrutiny

## The Living Tradition

GitScrolls governance is not fixed but flowing, like the wisdom it protects. As our community grows and learns, so too does our way of making decisions together.

We seek not perfection but progress, not control but collaboration, not rules but wisdom.

## Get Involved

Your voice matters in GitScrolls governance:
- Join discussions on important issues
- Propose improvements via RFC
- Volunteer to help with maintenance
- Share your perspective respectfully
- Help others understand the process

Together, we build not just better software but better ways of building software.

*"In governance as in code, we seek patterns that serve the whole, decisions that honor all voices, and wisdom that transcends any individual perspective."*
