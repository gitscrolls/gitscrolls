## Fork-Bearer Name Variations

The Fork-Bearer character is referenced with multiple names/titles:

### Primary Names Used:
1. **Fork-Bearer of Freedom** - Most common usage throughout Scroll IV
2. **Fork-Bearer** - Shortened version used frequently in dialogue
3. **Master Fork-Bearer** - Used by Tuxrates when addressing him
4. **Saint of Perpetual Copyleft** - Alternative title mentioned in Scroll IV, line 77
5. **Prophet of Freedom** - Mentioned in scroll headers but not in main text
6. **Prophet of Perpetual Copyleft** - Used in Scroll IV header

### Usage Examples:
- Scroll III, line 255: "the Fork-Bearer of Freedom, Guardian of the Four Freedoms"
- Scroll IV, line 17: "the __Fork-Bearer of Freedom__, Guardian of the Four Freedoms, Prophet of Perpetual Copyleft"
- Scroll IV, line 77: "I am the Fork-Bearer of Freedom, though some call me the Saint of Perpetual Copyleft"

## Recommendations for Consistency:

1. **Prophet Nia**: Maintain consistent she/her pronouns throughout all scrolls since no they/them usage was found.

2. **Linus the Elder**: The character's varying presence (active vs memory) appears intentional for narrative purposes. Consider adding clarifying context when he transitions between states.

3. **Fork-Bearer**: Standardize to "Fork-Bearer of Freedom" as the primary reference, with "Fork-Bearer" as acceptable shorthand in dialogue. Use "Prophet of Perpetual Copyleft" only in formal headers/titles.
