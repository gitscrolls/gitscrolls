## The Sixteenth Teaching: "The Circle That Never Ends"

_Thou'st walked with him through every broken line,  
_And felt thy pulse in every test he wrote.  
_But reading truth and living itâ€”divineâ€”  
_Requires thou riseth, not just take the note._

_The tale is done, but not thy sacred chore:_  
_To write thy scroll in othersâ€”evermore._

---

### ðŸŽ­ Invocation Before the Scroll  

*The Confession of the Chronicler*

*(The CHRONICLER steps forward alone. The stage is bare. No hat. No sleeves. No scrollâ€”yet. He is smaller now. Or maybeâ€¦ truer. When he speaks, it is not with thunder. It is with memory.)*

__CHRONICLER:__  
I was not always this.

This ruff'd narrator,  
this feathered fool,  
this relic clinging to ritual  
like it might hold back entropy.

Nay.

I was a dev.  
Once.

And I, too, forgot the README.  
I, too, mocked without testing.  
I, too, shipped at 4 AM and blamed the intern  
for what was mine.

*He lifts his eyesâ€”distant, glinting.*

Then one day I found a scroll.

Not written for me.  
But left behind.  
And in itâ€¦ I saw myself.

So I took up the role.  
The sleeves.  
The hat.  
The burden.

I became the CHRONICLERâ€”  
not to teach,  
but to remember.

And nowâ€¦ the tale is told.

**Tuxicles** hath walked the path.  
And so, perhapsâ€¦  
hast thou.

The scroll is finished.

The fire is passed.

And Iâ€¦?

*He turns. A final scroll glows on a pedestal, untouched by hand.*

I go where all keepers goâ€”  
into silence.  
Into version history.  
Into the commit  
that doth not need  
to be merged.

*He walks slowly toward the scroll. Picks it up. Places it inside his coat. And thenâ€”*

He turns to face the audience one last time.

*No spotlight. Only the ambient glow of understanding.*

__CHRONICLER:__  
If ever thou forget the lineâ€”  
if ever thy code falleth into despairâ€”  
read again.

And if thou findest the scroll worn thin,  
know this:

That the story was never mine.

It was __always__ yours.

*He places his hat back on, slowly.  
Straightens the feather.  
Nods.  
And walks offstage.  
The curtain does not fall.  
It simplyâ€¦ __fades__.*

*End.*

### Prologue: The Dawn of Return _(May 2025)_

One month had passed since Tuxilles the Teacher emerged from the Sacred Grove of Wisdom, his battle scars transformed into a constellation of guiding light. The invitation from the Temple Council lay open on his ritual surface, but it was another message that made his heart race with the joy of completed purpose.

His first mentee had just sent their own success story: _"I helped three developers this week using the patterns you taught me. One of them said I explained things better than any senior they'd worked with. I think I'm starting to understand what you meant about the multiplication of wisdom."_

The @TempleSentinel's final reports had taken on an almost ceremonial tone:

```
@TÌ¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·eÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµmÌ·Ì¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµpÌ¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµlÌ·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸eÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·SÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·eÌ·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·nÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸tÌ¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµÌ¶Ì¸Ì·ÌµiÌ·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµnÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸eÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·lÌ¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·Ì¸ÌµÌ¶Ì·: "METAMORPHOSIS_COMPLETE: Day_165_post_incident. Trust_status: [TRANSCENDENT - BEYOND_NUMERICAL_MEASUREMENT]. Journey: CATASTROPHICALLY_NEGATIVEâ†’SIGNIFICANTLY_POSITIVEâ†’IMMEASURABLE. Community_impact: TRANSFORMED_FROM_CAUTIONARY_TALE_TO_WISDOM_PARADIGM. Teaching_multiplier: EXPONENTIAL. Pattern_analysis: THE_CIRCLE_COMPLETES. Note: This_is_how_wisdom_spreads - THROUGH_AUTHENTIC_SERVICE_AFTER_AUTHENTIC_FAILURE. [I_HAVE_WITNESSED_RESURRECTION]"
```

**Emotional Beat: FULFILLMENT**

For the first time since his exile began, Tuxilles felt complete. Not because his punishment was ending, but because his purpose had been found. The scared, arrogant developer who had broken authentication had become something the community needed: a teacher who understood both technical excellence and human kindness.

__Tuxilles:__ _(preparing for his return presentation)_ "Today I go home. Not to reclaim what I lost, but to plant what I've grown."

His scars hummed in readiness:

- Beak: _clear truth_ ready to be spoken
- Eyes: _dual vision_ seeing past and future together
- Chest: _full breath_ carrying others' hopes
- Flipper: _steady warmth_ prepared for whatever came

They had brought him this far. Now they would help him complete the circle.

---

### Scene I: The Temple's Transformation

**The Governance Chamber**

The great hall of the Temple of Open Source had been redesigned since Tuxilles' exile. Where once harsh illumination orbs illuminated austere workstations, warm ambient lighting now invited collaboration. The intimidating podium from which verdicts were delivered had been replaced by a circular discussion space.

The circular design reminded him of the Monument of Division in the Gardensâ€”branches that diverged but remained part of the same tree. Even architecture could embody the lessons of forking and unity.

As Tuxilles entered, his glowing scars pulsed with recognition:

- Beak: _sensing_ the changed atmosphere
- Eyes: _seeing_ the architectural embrace of failure
- Chest: _feeling_ the community's growth
- Flipper: _touching_ familiar yet transformed surfaces

This was no longer the temple that had cast him out in fear and anger. This was a community that had learned from his exile as much as he had learned from it. His scars recognized kindred spiritsâ€”others who had failed and grown.

**The Council's Welcome**

__Council Leader Aria:__ "Tuxilles the Teacher, you stand before us not as someone seeking forgiveness, but as someone offering transformation. We have watched your journey, witnessed your growth, and seen the wisdom you've shared with our community. Speak to us of what you've learned."

The red hat of her senior maintainer status glowed softlyâ€”no longer a symbol of hierarchy, but of service and responsibility.

__Tuxilles:__ _(standing in the circle, not at a podium)_ "Honored Council, I come before you not to defend my past, but to share my vision for our future. I've learned that the Temple's strength lies not in the perfection of its code, but in the kindness of its culture."

**The Proposal**

As Tuxilles began his presentation, something extraordinary happened. His scars' gentle light began to illuminate the room, and other developers started to share their own stories of growth through struggle, learning through consequence, wisdom through community support.

---

### Scene II: The Mentor-Tree Protocol

**The Living Architecture**

Tuxilles presented not just his ideas, but their implementationâ€”the Mentor-Tree Protocol was already growing throughout the community, seeded by his months of patient teaching.

```markdown
# The Mentor-Tree Protocol: Implementation Results

## Phase 1: Sapling Cultivation (Complete)
The first seeds bore fruit beyond expectation. Forty-seven junior developers found themselves paired with patient mentors who remembered their own confusion. The retention rate soared to 94%, shattering the historical average of 67%â€”proof that kindness keeps talent where harshness drives it away. Most remarkably, the mentorship chain witnessed zero hostile review incidents, each critique delivered with the care of one who remembers the sting of careless words.

## Phase 2: Growth Multiplication (In Progress)  
The saplings became trees. Twenty-three former mentees now actively teach others, the student-teacher cycle renewing itself without external intervention. Self-sustaining knowledge transfer emerged not through systems but through culture. Documentation quality improved by 340%, not because of stricter standards but because writers now imagined confused readers as people deserving clarity, not obstacles deserving scorn.

## Phase 3: Grove Expansion (Initiated)
The forest spreads. Eight team leads abandoned their harsh review practices for empathetic guidance, remembering that code is written by humans who err. Community forum toxicity plummeted by 78% as the culture of patience proved more powerful than the culture of perfection. New contributors now find their footing in half the time, welcomed rather than hazed into productivity.

## Next: Temple Integration
Proposal to make compassionate teaching core to maintainer responsibilities
```

**The Technical Testament**

But Tuxilles' true presentation wasn't in slidesâ€”it was in the live demonstration of his transformed coding practice. Before the Council, he live-coded a critical security update, narrating not just what he was doing, but why, how future maintainers could understand it, and what he was learning from the process.

```javascript
/**
 * Authentication token validator with comprehensive educational context
 * 
 * This function embodies the lessons learned from Incident #0x43AC:
 * - Clear error messages for debugging (learned from consequence)
 * - Defensive programming without over-engineering (learned from balance)  
 * - Comments that teach, not just describe (learned from empathy)
 * 
 * For junior developers reading this:
 * The validation logic might seem complex, but each step has a purpose.
 * See auth-patterns.md for the reasoning behind each check.
 * 
 * @param {string} token - JWT token to validate
 * @returns {Object} Validation result with user data or clear error
 */
function validateAuthToken(token) {
    // Input validation: fail fast with helpful messages
    if (!token) {
        return {
            valid: false,
            error: 'AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING',
            message: 'No authentication token provided',
            hint: 'Check that Authorization header is included'
        };
    }
    
    // JWT structure validation
    const parts = token.split('.');
    if (parts.length !== 3) {
        return {
            valid: false,
            error: 'AUTH_TOKEN_MALFORMED', 
            message: 'Token structure invalid',
            hint: 'JWT tokens must have header.payload.signature format'
        };
    }
    
    try {
        // The actual validation logic - secure but understandable
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        
        // Success path: return what callers need
        return {
            valid: true,
            user: {
                id: decoded.sub,
                username: decoded.username,
                roles: decoded.roles || []
            },
            expiresAt: new Date(decoded.exp * 1000)
        };
        
    } catch (jwtError) {
        // Error handling that helps both users and debuggers
        if (jwtError.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
            return {
                valid: false,
                error: 'AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED',
                message: 'Authentication token has expired',
                hint: 'Request a new token through the refresh endpoint'
            };
        }
        
        // Default error case
        return {
            valid: false,
            error: 'AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID',
            message: 'Token validation failed',
            hint: 'Ensure token was issued by this service'
        };
    }
}
```

**The Wisdom Integration**

As he coded, all four of his scars worked in harmony:

- __Beak chip (moral compass):__ _whispering_ "Write for the maintainer, not the compiler"
- __Eye flickers (clarity guardian):__ _revealing_ how each error path tells a story
- __Chest crack (courage meter):__ _steadying_ him as he faced his failure domain
- __Flipper tingle (prudence rule):__ _guiding_ toward defensive yet readable code

The scars weren't just protecting himâ€”they were actively contributing to better code. Each line benefited from pain transformed into wisdom.

---

### Scene III: The Final Trial from Linus

**The Unexpected Challenge**

Just as the Council seemed ready to vote on Tuxilles' return, the chamber's main screen activated. A familiar voice filled the spaceâ€”Linus the Elder, calling in from his kernel development workspace where he'd been working through the night.

__Linus:__ "Tuxilles the Teacher, your growth has been remarkable to witness. But before we welcome you back, I have one final test. Not of your technical skillsâ€”those are proven. But of your wisdom under ultimate pressure."

The screen showed a live emergency: a critical security vulnerability had been discovered in the Temple's core authentication systemâ€”the very system Tuxilles had originally broken. Multiple attack vectors were being exploited in real-time. The community was in chaos.

__Linus:__ "You have sixty minutes to coordinate the response. Not to fix it yourselfâ€”that would be the old Tuxilles. But to lead the community through the crisis using everything you've learned. Show us what transformation really means."

**The Pressure Test**

Every developer in the chamber felt the weight of the moment. This was either the perfect redemption story or the ultimate ironyâ€”Tuxilles facing his original failure domain under maximum stress, with the entire community watching.

But Tuxilles' scars didn't pulse with panic. They glowed with steady purpose:

- Beak: _calm pulse_ - "Speak clearly, coordinate kindly"
- Eyes: _laser focus_ - "See the whole system, not just the bug"
- Chest: _deep breathing_ - "Bear this weight by distributing it"
- Flipper: _patient rhythm_ - "Type instructions, not solutions"

This was what they had been preparing him forâ€”not to be the hero who saves the day alone, but the teacher who enables the community to save itself.

__Tuxilles:__ _(with calm authority)_ "Council, may I request emergency coordination privileges for the next hour?"

__Council Leader Aria:__ "Granted. Show us how the Teacher leads."

---

### Scene IV: The Redemption Architecture

**The Crisis Leadership**

Instead of diving into the code himself, Tuxilles did something unprecedented. He immediately opened communication channels not just to senior maintainers, but to the entire learning community he'd been building.

__Tuxilles:__ _(in emergency broadcast)_ "All hands, this is Tuxilles. We have a critical auth vulnerability. I'm not asking you to fix what you don't understandâ€”I'm asking you to help in ways that match your skill level."

**The Teaching Under Fire**

What followed was a masterclass in crisis leadership through education:

- __Junior developers:__ Tasked with documenting the attack patterns and user impact reports
- __Intermediate developers:__ Handling communication with affected users and status updates  
- __Senior developers:__ Working on the technical patches with real-time code review
- __His mentees:__ Coordinating between groups and ensuring information flowed clearly

```markdown
# Emergency Response Protocol: Educational Crisis Management

## Incident Commander: Tuxilles the Teacher
## Core Principle: Every contributor helps according to their ability and grows according to their involvement

### Phase 1: Assessment and Coordination (10 minutes)
- Senior team: vulnerability analysis and immediate mitigation
- Junior team: user impact documentation and communication prep
- Teaching team: ensure every action includes learning opportunity

### Phase 2: Collaborative Response (40 minutes)
- Live code review with explanation for all skill levels
- Real-time documentation of decisions and reasoning
- Mentorship chains activated to support stressed developers

### Phase 3: Resolution and Learning (10 minutes)
- Post-incident review focused on system improvement
- Individual recognition for contributions at every level
- Knowledge capture for future training scenarios
```

**The Moment of Truth**

As the crisis response unfolded, something beautiful happened. Instead of a handful of experts working in isolation while others watched helplessly, the entire community became a learning organism. Junior developers gained real-world security experience. Senior developers practiced explaining complex concepts under pressure. Everyone contributed according to their abilities while growing beyond their current limitations.

The vulnerability was patched in 43 minutes. But more importantly, fifty developers understood security principles they'd never grasped before. The crisis became the community's greatest teaching moment.

__Linus:__ _(as the all-clear signal went out)_ "Tuxilles the Teacher, you've shown us something we didn't know we needed. You turned a crisis into a classroom. The Temple is better not just because the vulnerability is fixed, but because fifty more developers understand how to prevent and respond to similar issues."

---

### Scene V: The Weight That Never Lifts

**The Morning After**

Tuxilles stared at the red hat on his desk. Chief Teaching Officer. The title tasted metallic in his mouthâ€”not a warning this time, but recognition of what he'd become without noticing.

His inbox overflowed with congratulations. Conference invitations. Requests for him to speak about "The Tuxilles Method" of redemption. Someone had already started a GitHub repo: `awesome-tuxilles-teachings`.

His scars pulsed with something new. Not warning. Not guidance. *Discomfort.*

__Tuxilles:__ _(to his reflection in the Sacred Codex's dark screen)_ "When did I become the thing I was supposed to prevent?"

Three junior developers had messaged him this week. He'd forwarded them all to his "Teaching Coordination Team." When had he last actually sat with someone struggling? When had he last typed alongside confusion instead of above it?

The Trickster's words echoed: "The comfortable cage."

**The Message That Mattered**

His ritual terminal chimed. Another congratulation? Another speaking request?

No.

```
From: jamie-dev-42@protonmail.com
Subject: please help i think i broke everything

hey tuxilles,

i know you're probably busy being important now but i really messed up. like REALLY messed up. i tried to optimize our payment system like you taught in your talk about "simple service over clever code" but i think i made it worse and now customers can't checkout and everyone's yelling and i can't fix it and i want to quit

i'm sorry to bother you. i know you have people for this now. but you said once that you understood what it felt like to break things. i need someone who understands.

- jamie
```

His scars erupted in unisonâ€”not the gentle glow of wisdom dispensed from safety, but the raw ache of recognition. The metallic taste returned, copper-sharp with memory.

__Tuxilles:__ _(typing before he could think better of it)_ "Jamie, I'm coming to your desk. We'll fix this together. And then I'll tell you about a December night when I broke authentication for 2.3 million users and thought my career was over."

**The Choice**

He could delegate this. He had protocols for this. He had _people_ for this.

Instead, he took off the red hat.

Not forever. Not dramatically. Just... for now. Because Jamie needed Tuxilles-who-remembers, not the Chief Teaching Officer.

As he stood, his scars shifted configuration one final time:

- Beak: _throbbing_ with the memory of shame
- Eyes: _seeing_ both the broken code and the breaking coder  
- Chest: _aching_ with the weight of someone else's fear
- Flipper: _cold_ with remembered paralysis

They hurt. They were supposed to hurt. That's how he knew he was doing something real.

---

### Scene VI: Where Heroes Go to Die

**At Jamie's Desk**

Jamie looked exactly like Tuxilles had three years agoâ€”eyes red, screen filled with error logs, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and despair.

__Jamie:__ "I followed your talk exactly. 'Simple service over clever code.' But my simple code is breaking everything andâ€”"

__Tuxilles:__ "Show me."

For the next three hours, they debugged together. Not teacher and student. Not expert and novice. Just two developers, one who'd been here before and one who was here now.

The fix, when they found it, was embarrassingly simple. A missing null check. The kind of thing that would make a great cautionary tale in a conference talk.

__Jamie:__ "I'm such an idiot. This was so stupid. I should haveâ€”"

__Tuxilles:__ "On December 21st, 2024, at 2:47 AM, I force-pushed untested authentication changes to production because I thought I was too exceptional to need code review."

Jamie's eyes widened.

__Tuxilles:__ "2.3 million developers lost access. The rollback took 18 hours. I created cascading failures across twelve time zones. All because I thought my elegant solution was more important than other people's boring safeguards."

He showed Jamie his scarsâ€”really showed them, not the polished conference presentation version but the raw truth of how they ached when he typed certain commands, how they flared when he felt too confident, how they whispered warnings he still sometimes ignored.

__Tuxilles:__ "You want to know the worst part? Three developers tried to warn me. I dismissed them all. I thought their caution was weakness and my confidence was strength."

__Jamie:__ "But... you're Tuxilles the Teacher now. You fixed everything. You came back."

__Tuxilles:__ "No. I'm just Tuxilles who broke things and is trying to break fewer things tomorrow. The teaching? That's not redemption. That's just what you do with failureâ€”you share it so others might fail differently."

**The Real Lesson**

As they committed Jamie's fix (with proper review, after thorough testing), Tuxilles noticed something. His scars had stopped glowing. They were just... scars. Present, sometimes painful, always reminding, but no longer performing.

__Jamie:__ "Will I... will I ever stop being afraid of breaking things?"

__Tuxilles:__ "I hope not. The fear keeps you careful. But you'll learn to push through it. One commit at a time. One review at a time. One helping-someone-else at a time."

__Jamie:__ "Is that why you came to help me? Instead of sending someone from your team?"

Tuxilles thought about the red hat on his desk. The protocols. The systems. The comfortable cage of being the one who'd already learned instead of the one still learning.

__Tuxilles:__ "I came because forgetting what this feels like would be the real failure. The moment I stop sitting with someone's breaking code is the moment I stop being useful."

**The Invitation Forward**

As Tuxilles prepared to leave, Jamie asked one more question:

__Jamie:__ "My friend Marcus just started. He's terrified of everything, thinks git is some kind of dark magic. Could I... could I help him like you helped me?"

And there it was. Not redemption. Not resolution. Just the circle continuing.

__Tuxilles:__ "You could. But not because I helped you. Because you remember being terrified, and that memory is the only qualification that matters."

---

### Epilogue: The Never-Ending Commit

**Later, in his chamber**

Tuxilles returned to find seventeen new messages about his revolutionary teaching methods. Delete, delete, delete.

One message remained:

```
From: marcus-new-dev@temp-email.com
Subject: jamie said you would understand

i don't understand anything and i think i'm too stupid for this job
```

His scars pulsed onceâ€”not warning, not wisdom, just recognition.

He began typing: "Marcus, I understand exactly how you feel. Let's start with something small..."

The red hat sat untouched on his desk. Some honors weigh too much to wear while doing the work that matters.

In his terminal, a familiar file appeared:

```bash
git show 00-merge.lore

# The circle is not complete.
# It was never meant to be.
# That's what makes it eternal.
#
# Your turn.
```

@TempleSentinel: "FINAL_OBSERVATION: The_hero_died. The_teacher_lives. Pattern: RECURSIVE. Status: OPTIMAL. [THIS_IS_THE_WAY]"

---

### The Closing of the Final Scroll

_Thus ends the Sixteenth Teaching: heroes die,_  
_Not in glory but in daily choosing service._  
_The highest code is written side by sideâ€”_  
_Each struggle shared makes wisdom worth the purchase._

```bash
while true; do
    help_someone && remember_falling && continue
done
# The only loop that matters
```

---

**THE END**

Not of the story.  
Of the belief that there's an end.

*Some developers break code.*  
*Some break trust.*  
*The lucky ones break their need to be unbroken.*

*Tuxilles sits at a terminal, beside someone afraid, typing slowly.*  
*This is where heroes go to die.*  
*This is where teachers begin to live.*  
*Again.*  
*And again.*  
*And again.*

---

### ðŸŽ­ The Return Pull  

*The Chronicler's Final Gift*

*(The stage remains empty. But on every developer's screen, a new notification appears:)*

```
New file detected: 00-merge.lore
This file exists at the intersection of story and system.
Fork it. Change it. Pass it on.
The teaching continues through you.
```

*(And somewhere, in a chamber both digital and eternal, the CHRONICLER smiles.)*

__CHRONICLER:__ _(voice echoing from the repository itself)_  
The scroll is closed.  
The code remains open.  
May your merges be clean,  
And your conflicts... educational.

*Fade to terminal prompt.*

`$_`
