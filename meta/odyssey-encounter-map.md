**Linus:** *"I see you have learned what I could not teach. You have earned your place among us."*

**The Scar Reading:**
- **Linus examines each scar**, understanding the lessons
- **Other masters gather**, each recognizing their teachings reflected in his wounds
- **The red hat** marks him as enterprise-level wisdom carrier

#### The Sacred Assignment:
