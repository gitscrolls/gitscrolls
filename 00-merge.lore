# 00-merge.lore

**A living document of passed wisdom**

*This file appears throughout the GitScrolls as a mysterious gift from the Trickster of GitHub Issues. It evolves as wisdom passes from teacher to student to teacher again.*

---

## Version 1: The Trickster's Original

```
To teach is to be misunderstood by the future.
When your students fork your scrolls, rejoice.
When they break them, rejoice louder.

---

git show 00-merge.lore
# This file will make sense when you need it to.
# Save it for when your teaching feels futile.
# Remember: every bug is a feature request,
# and every student is a teacher in training.

The Trickster sends their regards.
```

*First appears in GitScroll VI, when Tuxilles learns to resist the Sirens of easy solutions.*

---

## Version 2: Tuxilles' Revision

```
Some truths must be misread before they can be understood.
If they break your teachings, they are trying.
If they fork your wisdom, they are yours.
If they teach it themselves, they are you.

The greatest gift you can give a student
is the courage to surpass you.

---

To the next teacher who finds this:
You were someone's Tuxrates once.
Now be someone's Trickster.

git show 00-merge.lore
# This file will make sense when you need it to.
# When it does, change it and pass it on.
# The lore lives in the sharing.
```

*Completed in GitScroll X, when Tuxilles finally understands the cycle of wisdom.*

**Note:** This file exists at the intersection of mythology and reality. It serves as both:
- A narrative device within the GitScrolls
- A real artifact that can be shared, modified, and passed forward
- A framework for thinking about how wisdom spreads through communities

The Trickster would approve of this confusion between story and system.

*"Time is just another merge strategy, young teacher. Some commits only make sense when you're ready to receive them."*
