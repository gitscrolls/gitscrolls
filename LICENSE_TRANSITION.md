# ðŸ“œ License Transition Notice

As of **June 7, 2025**, GitScrolls has transitioned from the MIT License to the  
[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

## ðŸ§¾ Summary

- **Commits 1â€“89**: Licensed under MIT  
    - Final MIT-licensed commit is tagged: [`v0.1-mit-license`](https://github.com/your-org/gitscrolls/releases/tag/v0.1-mit-license)

This shift reflects the evolution of GitScrolls from a simple code artifact to a mythic-philosophical narrative intended for teaching, reflection, and transformation â€” not commercial exploitation.

---

## ðŸ§  Why the Change?

The MIT License is designed for software. GitScrolls is not just software â€” it is a **living text**, a developerâ€™s scripture, and a satirical-philosophical exploration of the craft.

By moving to **CC BY-NC-SA**, we protect the work from corporate appropriation while still encouraging free remixing, teaching, and derivative creations â€” as long as they're non-commercial and equally open.

*"Licenses are like branches: they diverge, they merge, but only history remembers who authored the change."*
